# Proposal for the CLC3 Project

##  Project Members:

* Mathias Brucker
* Peter Fehringer
* Manuel Wechselberger

## Definition

The CLC3 Project is focused on enhancing the understanding and monitoring of microservice architectures through the application of OpenTelemetry and Jaeger. 

The project will involve:

* instrumenting a minimum of three microservices with OpenTelemetry
* using Jaeger to display and analyze the traces of their interactions

## Scope

The project includes:

* setup of microservices
* integration of OpenTelemetry and Jaeger
* data collection and analysis
* documentation
* final presentation including a live demo

## Milestones

1. *Initial Setup and Planning:* Selection of microservices, initial setup of OpenTelemetry and Jaeger, and detailed project planning
2. *Integration:* Implementing OpenTelemetry in selected microservices
3. *Testing & Data Collection and Analysis:* Testing integration with Jaeger to enable data collection, followed by thorough analysis to understand service interactions
4. *Documentation and Presentation Preparation:* Finalizing documentation and preparing for the project presentation and live demo

## Assignment of Responsibilities

Mathias Brucker:

* Technical implementation of OpenTelemetry
* Developing a detailed, step-by-step tutorial for the Instrumentation

Peter Fehringer

* Integration in Jaeger
* Developing a detailed, step-by-step tutorial for the setup and integration process

Manuel Wechselberger

* Finding suitable microservices
* Summarizing lessons learned from the project's execution and findings
* Preparing the live demo
